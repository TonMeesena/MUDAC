#Questions

#Q4) The MUDAC 2020 challenge is centered around the desire to better understand what influences the final outcome of a case. Recall, the primary outcomes of this investigation are 1) whether or not the case was terminated via a motion to dismiss, 2) whether or not the case was terminated via a motion for summary judgement, and 3) whether or not the case was settled before going to trial

##a) [Level: Beginner/Intermediate] Identify characteristics of a case that appear to be indicative of a caseâ€™s outcome
```{r}
#growing trees
train_summary_judgment <- train_dockets %>% select(-c(outcome, settled, dismissed,mudac_id,primarytitle,nos_text))
tree_summary_judgment <- rpart(summary_judgment ~ ., data = train_summary_judgment, method = "class")

train_settled <- train_dockets %>% select(-c(outcome, summary_judgment, dismissed,mudac_id,primarytitle,nos_text))
tree_settled <- rpart(settled ~ ., data = train_settled, method = "class")

train_dismissed <- train_dockets %>% select(-c(outcome, settled, summary_judgment,mudac_id,primarytitle,nos_text))
tree_dismissed <- rpart(dismissed ~ ., data = train_dismissed, method = "class")
```

```{r}
#printing trees
tree_summary_judgment
plot(as.party(tree_summary_judgment), type = "simple")
tree_settled
plot(as.party(tree_settled))
tree_dismissed
plot(as.party(tree_dismissed))
```

```{r}
#growing forrest
rf_summary_judgment <- randomForest(summary_judgment ~ ., data = train_summary_judgment)
rf_settled <- randomForest(settled ~ ., data = train_settled)
rf_dismissed <- randomForest(dismissed ~ ., data = train_dismissed)
```

##b) [Level: Intermediate] Identify any relevant demographic features of a district/court venue that may influence the outcome of a case
```{r}

```


##c)[Level: Intermediate] Investigate any relationships that may exist between the outcome of a case and the various terminating motions that are made
```{r}

```


##d) [Level: Intermediate] Investigate any relationships that may exist between the outcome of a case and the various non-terminating motions that are made
```{r}
tree_summary_judgment_other <- rpart(summary_judgment ~ motion_type + filing_party + filed_before_joined +
                                 decison + decided_before_joined + proceeding_precentile, 
                               data = train_other, method = "class")

tree_settled_other <- rpart(settled ~ motion_type + filing_party + filed_before_joined +
                                 decison + decided_before_joined + proceeding_precentile, 
                               data = train_other, method = "class")

tree_dismissed_other <- rpart(dismissed ~ motion_type + filing_party + filed_before_joined +
                                 decison + decided_before_joined + proceeding_precentile, 
                               data = train_other, method = "class")
```

```{r}
tree_summary_judgment_other
plot(as.party(tree_summary_judgment_other), type = "simple")
tree_settled_other
plot(as.party(tree_settled_other))
tree_dismissed_other
plot(as.party(tree_dismissed_other))
```


##e) [Level: Intermediate] Identify any relationships that may exist between the outcome of a case and whether or not a non-terminating motion is granted/denied
