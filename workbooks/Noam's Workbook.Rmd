#Questions

#Q4) The MUDAC 2020 challenge is centered around the desire to better understand what influences the final outcome of a case. Recall, the primary outcomes of this investigation are 1) whether or not the case was terminated via a motion to dismiss, 2) whether or not the case was terminated via a motion for summary judgement, and 3) whether or not the case was settled before going to trial

##a) [Level: Beginner/Intermediate] Identify characteristics of a case that appear to be indicative of a caseâ€™s outcome
###splitting data
```{r}
#Using LM
train_summary_judgment_lm <- glm(summary_judgment ~ ., data =train_summary_judgment, family = "binomial")
train_settled_lm <- glm(settled ~ ., data =train_settled, family = "binomial")
train_dismissed_lm <- glm(dismissed ~ ., data =train_dismissed, family = "binomial")

stargazer(train_summary_judgment_lm, train_settled_lm, train_dismissed_lm, type = "text")
```



##b) [Level: Intermediate] Identify any relevant demographic features of a district/court venue that may influence the outcome of a case
```{r}
train_summary_judgment_demog <- district_w_demog %>% select(-c(outcome, settled, dismissed))

train_settled_demog <- district_w_demog %>% select(-c(outcome, summary_judgment, dismissed))

train_dismissed_demog <- district_w_demog %>% select(-c(outcome, settled, summary_judgment))

demographics_summary_judgment_lm <- glm(summary_judgment ~ ., data = train_summary_judgment_demog, family = "binomial")
demographics_settled_lm <- glm(settled ~ ., data = train_settled_demog, family = "binomial")
demographics_dismissed_lm <- glm(dismissed ~ ., data = train_dismissed_demog, family = "binomial")
```


##c)[Level: Intermediate] Investigate any relationships that may exist between the outcome of a case and the various terminating motions that are made
```{r}
lm_SJ_train_term <- glm(summary_judgment ~ motion_type, select(train_termination, -c(mudac_id, outcome,settled,dismissed)), family = "binomial")
lm_set_train_term <- glm(settled ~ motion_type, select(train_termination, -c(mudac_id, outcome,summary_judgment,dismissed)), family = "binomial")
lm_dis_train_term <- glm(dismissed ~ motion_type, select(train_termination, -c(mudac_id, outcome,settled,summary_judgment)), family = "binomial")

stargazer(lm_SJ_train_term, lm_set_train_term, lm_dis_train_term, type = "text")
```


##d) [Level: Intermediate] Investigate any relationships that may exist between the outcome of a case and the various non-terminating motions that are made
```{r}
lm_SJ_train_oth <- glm(summary_judgment ~ motion_type, select(train_other, -c(mudac_id, outcome,settled,dismissed)), family = "binomial")
lm_set_train_oth <- glm(settled ~ motion_type, select(train_other, -c(mudac_id, outcome,summary_judgment,dismissed)), family = "binomial")
lm_dis_train_oth <- glm(dismissed ~ motion_type, select(train_other, -c(mudac_id, outcome,settled,summary_judgment)), family = "binomial")

stargazer(lm_SJ_train_oth, lm_set_train_oth, lm_dis_train_oth, type = "text")
```



##e) [Level: Intermediate] Identify any relationships that may exist between the outcome of a case and whether or not a non-terminating motion is granted/denied
```{r}
train_other_decision_twoleveled <- train_other %>% filter(decison == c("Denied", "Denied as Moot", "Granted", "Granted in Part"))
levels(train_other$decison)

condense_decision <- function(x){
  ifelse(x %in% c("Denied","Denied as Moot"), "Denied", "Granted")
}

train_other_decision_twoleveled$decison <- fct_relabel(train_other_decision_twoleveled$decison, condense_decision)

lm_SJ_train_oth <- glm(summary_judgment ~ ., select(train_other_decision_twoleveled, c(summary_judgment, decison)), family = "binomial")
lm_set_train_oth <- glm(settled ~ ., select(train_other_decision_twoleveled, c(settled, decison)), family = "binomial")
lm_dis_train_oth <- glm(dismissed ~ ., select(train_other_decision_twoleveled, c(dismissed, decison)), family = "binomial")

```


#Q5) [Level: Advanced] The MUDAC 2020 challenge includes a prediction component. This part of the competition will take place in Kaggle (additional information regarding Kaggle will be provided separately). MUDAC 2020 requires teams to build a predictive model that provides a probability that a case will be closed by a summary judgement and a second predictive model that provides a probability that a case will be closed by a settlement.
